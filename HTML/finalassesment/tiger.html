    <p>Tiger (Panthera tigris): The tiger is the largest of all the Asian big cats and is a member of the genus Panthera.

        Kingdom: | Animalia
        Phylum: | Chordata
        Class: | Mammalia
        Order: | Carnivora
        Family: | Felidae
        Genus: | Panthera
        Species: | tigris
        <h1>Size and Weight:</h1>
        <p>Tigers are the largest of all the Asian big cats. Tigers range from six to ten feet long, and they can weigh anywhere from 220 to 660 pounds.

            Males of the larger subspecies, the continental tiger, weigh up to 660 pounds. While males of the smaller subspecies, the Sunda tiger, weigh up to 310 pounds. The males are typically heavier than females in both subspecies</p>
        <h1>Appearance:</h1>
        <p>Tigers are known for their dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. Their coloring and marking depend on the subspecies and the tiger’s location. While many of the large continental tigers have pale orange fur with few stripes, the smaller Sunda tigers have dark, thickly striped fur.

            Tigers can also be black with tan stripes, all white (albino), or white and tan. In some zoos, there may be “white tigers.” These tigers are not albino but rather the white-and-tan color variation with blue eyes. True albinos are very rare and have pink eyes, according to the San Diego Zoo.
            
            Each tiger’s markings are unique. Their stripes are as individual as fingerprints are for humans. Most tigers have over 100 stripes. In the wild, a tiger’s stripes are important for survival. They act as camouflage, appearing as moving shadows in long grass and in trees. This helps with hunting prey.</p>
        <h1>Diet:</h1>
        <p>The tiger is an apex predator, primarily hunting ungulates (hoofed mammals) like deer and wild boar. They rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey. A tiger can consume more than 90 pounds of meat at one time.</p>
        <h1>Habitat:</h1>
        <p>Tigers can be found in various habitats, such as tropical rainforests, evergreen forests, temperate forests, mangrove swamps, grasslands and savannas.</p>
        <h1>Breeding:</h1>
        <p>Tigers are mostly solitary creatures, aside from the association between a mother and her offspring. On average, female tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years. Juvenile mortality is high in tigers, and more than half of cubs do not survive more than two years. If all the cubs in one litter die, a female may give birth to a second litter within five months.

            Tigers typically leave their mother and gain independence after two years of age. Females attain sexual maturity at age three or four, while males reach sexual maturity around four or five years.
            
            Individual tigers have a large territory, which they mark with urine, feces, rakes, scrapes and vocalizing. The size is mostly determined by the availability of prey.</p>
        <h1>Lifespan:</h1>
        <p>Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild. On average, tigers live 10 to 15 years in the wild.</p>
        There are two recognized subspecies of tiger: the continental (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sunda (Panthera tigris sondaica), according to IUCN</p>
