    <center><h1>Elephant</h1></center>
<p>Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild. On average, tigers live 10 to 15 years in the wild.There are currently three species of elephants across the globe: the African bush elephant (Elephas maximus bengalensis), the African forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).</p>
<h1>Size and Weight:</h1>
<p>Elephants weigh four to six tons. They are 18 to 24 feet long.</p>
<h1>Appearance:</h1>
<p>Elephants are the largest existing land animal, with massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. Elephants’ long trunks are multifunctional. They are used to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing.

    Elephants grow tusks or “extended teeth,” which also serve many purposes. They are used to protect the elephant’s trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, defend themselves, and strip bark from trees. Elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground during a drought.
    
    African and Asian elephants differ in their appearance, with more than 10 distinct physical differences between them. Asian elephants are smaller than African, including their ears. While both male and female African elephants grow tusks, only some male Asian elephants have tusks. The African elephant is the largest of all elephant species and weighs up to eight tons. There are also a number of differences between the two African elephants: the savanna and the forest elephant.</p>
<h1>Diet:</h1>
<p>Elephants are herbivores, and they need extensive land areas to survive. On average, an elephant can feed up to 18 hours and consume hundreds of pounds of plant matter in a single day.</p>
<h1>Habitat:</h1>
<p>Elephants are found in various habitats, such as marshes, forests, savannahs and deserts.</p>
<h1>Breeding:</h1>
<p>A single calf is born to a female elephant once every four to five years. The gestation period is 22 months, which is the longest gestation period of any mammal. Elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves, which are led by the matriarch. The calf is raised by the entire herd of female relatives. Female calves may stay with this maternal herd for the rest of their lives, but the males leave the herd once they reach puberty. Male elephants tend to live in isolation or in small bachelor groups.</p>
<h1>Lifespan:</h1>
<p>The lifespan of elephants is not yet well understood. Most of the available research is related to African elephants, which suggests that they rarely live to the age of 50. Evidence suggests that Asian elephants typically live into their mid-50s. There is not enough consistent data available on wild Asian elephants to accurately estimate their lifespan. The median life expectancy for female Asian elephants is 47-years-old.</p>
