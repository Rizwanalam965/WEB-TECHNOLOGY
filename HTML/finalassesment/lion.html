    <!-- <center><h1>Facts About Lions:</h1></center> -->
    <p>Lions are at the top of the food chain, with no natural predators. They are often depicted in stories and films as majestic and strong. Simba, the Swahili word for lion, means “king,” “strong,” and “aggressive.” Similarly, in English, to describe someone as “lionhearted” means that they are courageous and brave. An African lion’s roar can be heard up to 5 miles (8 km) away!
        While lions are large, powerful cats, their numbers have declined dramatically in recent years. African lion numbers have plummeted by over 40% in the last three generations, largely as a result of habitat loss and conflicts with humans.</p>
        <h1>Size and Weight:</h1>
        <p>Male lions are much larger than females. The length of a female is typically between 4.6 and 5.7 feet, while the length of a male is between 5.6 and 8.3 feet. Their tail length is 27 to 41 inches. Female lions weigh 270 to 400 pounds, while males weigh 330 to 570 pounds</p>
        <h1>Appearance:</h1>
        <p>Lions are known for muscular, deep-chested bodies. They have short, rounded heads, round ears, and hairy tufts at the end of their tails. Their appearance differs from that of other large cats, such as tigers, leopards and jaguars.

            Notably, male lions have a mane of hair around their neck. Typically, manes are grown exclusively by male lions. Occasionally, a female lion will grow a mane, perplexing experts. The mane’s color, size and abundance depend on the individual and its age. The mane not only helps the lion look more impressive to females but also more intimidating to other males. The lion’s mane may also protect the lion’s neck during a battle, typically with other males over territory and breeding rights</p>
            <h1>Diet:</h1>
            <p>Lions are carnivores. They are apex predators, meaning that they are at the top of the food chain with no natural predators. They hunt animals in their surrounding habitat, which typically includes antelopes and other hoofed animals. They may also hunt elephants, rhinos, rodents, reptiles, insects and even crocodiles. They also scavenge or steal prey from leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, or wild dogs.

                Lions typically hunt at night at dusk or dawn. Female lions, or lionesses, often do much of the hunting. When chasing prey, a lion can run the length of a football field in six seconds. Lions consume about 20 pounds (9 kg) of meat each day, although some can consume up to 100 pounds (45.5 kg) in one day.</p>
            <h1>Habitat:</h1>
            <p>Lions’ habitats include open woodlands, thick grassland, and brush habitat, where there is enough cover for hunting and denning</p>
            <h1>Breeding:</h1>
            <p>Female lions are the pride’s main hunters. They also raise their cubs communally and tend to stay with the pride as they age. After a four-month gestation period, a lioness will sneak away from the pride to give birth to a litter of two to six cubs. The cubs are about 3 pounds at birth with a yellowish-brown coat and distinct spots or stripes. Cubs remain hidden from the pride for the first four to six weeks while they gain strength. Cubs born in a pride are twice as likely to survive than a lioness on her own.

                The cubs stay close to their mother for the first few months. Lion cubs are vocal at birth, but don’t begin to roar until about one year old. They are eventually weaned by the age of six months. Females tend to stay with their mothers longer than males. Males will typically stay with their mother until they’re two, while females may stay with their mother in the pride for life. The sub-adult male will be chased out of the pride by his mother when he will then be out on his own or join a bachelor group. A bachelor group will run together until they are big enough to start challenging older males in an attempt to take over a pride</p>
